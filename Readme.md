### TL;DR ###

(WIP) CSS <-> React (style) here: https://htbkoo.github.io/CssToAndFromReact/ 

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repo is a fork of [staxmanade/CssToReact](https://github.com/staxmanade/CssToReact)
* The idea is great but I believe transformation from React Style back to CSS would also be useful
* So this repo is an attempt to add bi-directional transformation between React Styles <-> CSS
* In short these changes are added on top of the original repo
    - [x] updated .gitignore (because IntelliJ IDEA is used so some of the config files should be ignored as well)
    - [ ] (Just personal preference) migrated yarn / npm
    - [ ] (Just personal preference) migrated to TypeScript
    - [ ] Added automated test coverage
    - [ ] Added functionality to transform from React back to CSS
* An instance would be deployed to GitHub Page: https://htbkoo.github.io/CssToAndFromReact/
